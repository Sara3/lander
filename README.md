lander
======
write a main program that creates a lander and performs a brief flight. 
Set the fuel flow to 95% of maximum, and fire the engine for 20.0 seconds in 0.1 second increments. 
Then shut off the engine and let the lander coast for another 15.0 seconds in 0.1 second incre-ments.
Display the state of the lander three times: (1) the initial state, 
(2) the state after 20.0 seconds of firing the engine, and (3)
the state after 15.0 seconds of coasting.
